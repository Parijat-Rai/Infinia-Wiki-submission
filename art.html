              Art is a diverse range of human activity, and resulting product,
              that involves creative or imaginative talent expressive of

              considerations are paramount, the fine arts are separated and

            <div class="blog-slider__title">Overview</div>
            <div class="blog-slider__text">
              In the perspective of the history of art,[10] artistic works have
              existed for almost as long as humankind: from early prehistoric
              art to contemporary art; however, some theorists think that the
              typical concept of "artistic works" does not fit well outside
              modern Western societies.[11] One early sense of the definition of
              art is closely related to the older Latin meaning, which roughly
              translates to "skill" or "craft", as associated with words such as
              "artisan". English words derived from this meaning include
              artifact, artificial, artifice, medical arts, and military arts.
              However, there are many other colloquial uses of the word, all
              with some relation to its etymology. <br />
              <br />
              Over time, philosophers like Plato, Aristotle, Socrates and
              Immanuel Kant, among others, questioned the meaning of art.[12]
              Several dialogues in Plato tackle questions about art: Socrates
              says that poetry is inspired by the muses, and is not rational. He
              speaks approvingly of this, and other forms of divine madness
              (drunkenness, eroticism, and dreaming) in the Phaedrus (265a–c),
              and yet in the Republic wants to outlaw Homer's great poetic art,
              and laughter as well. In Ion, Socrates gives no hint of the
              disapproval of Homer that he expresses in the Republic. The
              dialogue Ion suggests that Homer's Iliad functioned in the ancient
              Greek world as the Bible does today in the modern Christian world:
              as divinely inspired literary art that can provide moral guidance,
              if only it can be properly interpreted.[13] <br />

              The more recent and specific sense of the word art as an
              abbreviation for creative art or fine art emerged in the early
              17th century.[17] Fine art refers to a skill used to express the
              artist's creativity, or to engage the audience's aesthetic
              sensibilities, or to draw the audience towards consideration of
              more refined or finer works of art.

              Within this latter sense, the word art may refer to several
              things: (i) a study of a creative skill, (ii) a process of using
              the creative skill, (iii) a product of the creative skill, or (iv)
              the audience's experience with the creative skill. The creative
              arts (art as discipline) are a collection of disciplines which
              produce artworks (art as objects) that are compelled by a personal
              drive (art as activity) and convey a message, mood, or symbolism
              for the perceiver to interpret (art as experience). Art is
              something that stimulates an individual's thoughts, emotions,
              beliefs, or ideas through the senses. Works of art can be
              explicitly made for this purpose or interpreted on the basis of
              images or objects. For some scholars, such as Kant, the sciences
              and the arts could be distinguished by taking science as
              representing the domain of knowledge and the arts as representing
              the domain of the freedom of artistic expression.[18] <br />
              <br />
              Often, if the skill is being used in a common or practical way,
              people will consider it a craft instead of art. Likewise, if the
              skill is being used in a commercial or industrial way, it may be
              considered commercial art instead of fine art. On the other hand,
              crafts and design are sometimes considered applied art. Some art
              followers have argued that the difference between fine art and
              applied art has more to do with value judgments made about the art
              than any clear definitional difference.[19] However, even fine art
              often has goals beyond pure creativity and self-expression. The
              purpose of works of art may be to communicate ideas, such as in
              politically, spiritually, or philosophically motivated art; to
              create a sense of beauty (see aesthetics); to explore the nature
              of perception; for pleasure; or to generate strong emotions. The
              purpose may also be seemingly nonexistent.

              The nature of art has been described by philosopher Richard
              Wollheim as "one of the most elusive of the traditional problems
              of human culture".[20] Art has been defined as a vehicle for the
              expression or communication of emotions and ideas, a means for
              exploring and appreciating formal elements for their own sake, and
              as mimesis or representation. Art as mimesis has deep roots in the
              philosophy of Aristotle.[21] Leo Tolstoy identified art as a use
              of indirect means to communicate from one person to another.[21]
              Benedetto Croce and R. G. Collingwood advanced the idealist view
              that art expresses emotions, and that the work of art therefore
              essentially exists in the mind of the creator.[22][23] The theory
              of art as form has its roots in the philosophy of Kant, and was
              developed in the early 20th century by Roger Fry and Clive Bell.
              More recently, thinkers influenced by Martin Heidegger have
              interpreted art as the means by which a community develops for
              itself a medium for self-expression and interpretation.[24] George
              Dickie has offered an institutional theory of art that defines a
              work of art as any artifact upon which a qualified person or
              persons acting on behalf of the social institution commonly
              referred to as "the art world" has conferred "the status of
              candidate for appreciation".[25] Larry Shiner has described fine
              art as "not an essence or a fate but something we have made. Art
              as we have generally understood it is a European invention barely
              two hundred years old."[26]<br />
              <br />
              Art may be characterized in terms of mimesis (its representation
              of reality), narrative (storytelling), expression, communication
              of emotion, or other qualities. During the Romantic period, art
              came to be seen as "a special faculty of the human mind to be
              classified with religion and science".[27]

              A shell engraved by Homo erectus was determined to be between
              430,000 and 540,000 years old.[29] A set of eight 130,000 years
              old white-tailed eagle talons bear cut marks and abrasion that
              indicate manipulation by neanderthals, possibly for using it as
              jewelry.[30] A series of tiny, drilled snail shells about 75,000
              years old—were discovered in a South African cave.[31] Containers
              that may have been used to hold paints have been found dating as
              far back as 100,000 years.[32] <br />
              <br />
              The oldest piece of art found in Europe is the Riesenhirschknochen
              der Einhornhöhle, dating back 51,000 years and made by
              Neanderthals. <br />
              <br />
              Sculptures, cave paintings, rock paintings and petroglyphs from
              the Upper Paleolithic dating to roughly 40,000 years ago have been
              found,[33] but the precise meaning of such art is often disputed
              because so little is known about the cultures that produced them.
              <br />
              <br />
              The first undisputed sculptures and similar art pieces, like the
              Venus of Hohle Fels, are the numerous objects found at the Caves
              and Ice Age Art in the Swabian Jura UNESCO World Heritage Site,
              where the oldest non-stationary works of human art yet discovered
              were found, in the form of carved animal and humanoid figurines,
              in addition to the oldest musical instruments unearthed so far,
              with the artifacts dating between 43.000 and 35.000 BC, so being
              the first centre of human art.[34][35][36][37]

              Many great traditions in art have a foundation in the art of one
              of the great ancient civilizations: Ancient Egypt, Mesopotamia,
              Persia, India, China, Ancient Greece, Rome, as well as Inca, Maya,
              and Olmec. Each of these centers of early civilization developed a
              unique and characteristic style in its art. Because of the size
              and duration of these civilizations, more of their art works have
              survived and more of their influence has been transmitted to other
              cultures and later times. Some also have provided the first
              records of how artists worked. For example, this period of Greek
              art saw a veneration of the human physical form and the
              development of equivalent skills to show musculature, poise,
              beauty, and anatomically correct proportions.[38]<br />
              <br />
              In Byzantine and Medieval art of the Western Middle Ages, much art
              focused on the expression of subjects about biblical and religious
              culture, and used styles that showed the higher glory of a
              heavenly world, such as the use of gold in the background of
              paintings, or glass in mosaics or windows, which also presented
              figures in idealized, patterned (flat) forms. Nevertheless, a
              classical realist tradition persisted in small Byzantine works,
              and realism steadily grew in the art of Catholic Europe.[39]
              <br />
              <br />
              Renaissance art had a greatly increased emphasis on the realistic
              depiction of the material world, and the place of humans in it,
              reflected in the corporeality of the human body, and development
              of a systematic method of graphical perspective to depict
              recession in a three-dimensional picture space.[40]
